                scroll social media with my coffee, but now I challenge myself
                with a fresh puzzle every day. The difficulty feels just right —
                not too easy, not too frustrating. I also love how smart the
                clues are; they’re never vague or silly. Plus, I’ve actually
                picked up new vocabulary along the way. The app layout is clean
                and calming, which makes the whole experience so pleasant. It’s

                have 10 minutes, I can squeeze in a puzzle and feel
                accomplished. The stats feature is also a great touch; it’s nice
